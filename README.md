## Interfaces in Go Challenge
In this challenge, we're exploring interfaces in Go. Your task is to create an interface called `Shape` with `Area()` and `Perimeter()` methods. Then, define two structs `Rectangle` and `Circle` that implement the `Shape` interface. Finally, write a function called `PrintShapeDetails()` that takes a `Shape` argument and prints its area and perimeter.
